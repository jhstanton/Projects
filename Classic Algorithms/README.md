Classic Algorithms
-----------------

**Collatz Conjecture** - Start with a number *n > 1*. Find the number of steps it takes to reach one using the following process: If *n* is even, divide it by 2. If *n* is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

**Sorting** - Implement two types of sorting algorithms: Merge sort and bubble sort.

**Closest pair problem** - The closest pair of points problem or closest pair problem is a problem of computational geometry: given *n* points in metric space, find a pair of points with the smallest distance between them.

**Sieve of Eratosthenes** - The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all of the smaller primes (below 10 million or so).

**Knight's Tour** - Given a recatangular board of dimensions M x N and a start point for a knight and that the knight can only touch each square once, find if the knight can touch each square. Bonus - return the board marked where each square is marked with the move number that touch it.

**Eight Queens** - Given a standard 8 x 8 chessboard and 8 queen pieces, find one of the piece arrangements where all 8 queens can be on the board without being within range of one another.
